Visualize a trained neural network weights from different libraries

## Intallation 
- pip3 install -e .

## TODO : 
1. Arise warning when neura-network size exceeds limits of library 
2. If neural-network size exceeds lib limits, offer to plot partial in these limits
3. Long term TODO : 3D visualisation

## Contribution
- We need to add some communication details here
