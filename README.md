# Neural Network Visualizer
Visualize a trained neural network weights from different libraries

## Intallation 
- pip3 install -e .

## TODO : 
1. Discover limits of library and plot partial in these limits
2. Add debug levels (its not common to see all debug prints every time) 
3. Make a base class for readers (Libraries/.)
4. Data passing through functions must be dynamical (give data in every step instead of giving in the beginning)
- Long term TODO : 3D visualisation

## Contribution
- We need to add some communication details here
